A couple of extra files in here

example-data-with-additions-d3.txt - is an example file with a few extra lines in it.
    I did that because I was concerned that d3-p1.awk wasn't processing the edges properly.
reduce.awk - Used to scan the input files and spit out all of the symbols. This was
    useful for d3-p1.awk but not for d3-p2.awk.

I'm not sure about anyone else, but the Part 2 pivot is usually what kills me.
